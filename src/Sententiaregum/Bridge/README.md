What is a bridge?
=================

Bridges connect the core domain layer with any framework.

These bridges are used in order to connect the domain with a sf2 environment using symfony components and doctrine.
I don't use symfony's bundles in this case, because these classes may be used in a silex project or maybe in a laravel project, too and these don't use bundles.
